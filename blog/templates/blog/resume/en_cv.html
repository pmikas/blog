        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have knowledge in ship design, logistics, and also in subsea systems concerning the oil and gas industry. During my academic experience I developed analytical and self-taught abilities, with the development of a code in Fortran programming language. I am currently pursuing professional improvement through courses focused on the programming languages R, Phyton and SQL with application in data analysis and visualization. I am a dedicated professional looking for new challenges and knowledge.</p><br>
