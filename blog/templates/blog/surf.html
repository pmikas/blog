    This project intends to help surf beginners to have a better understanding of wind and wave forecasts. During the project, as a beginner myself, I had to study some "surfing terms" and "surfing slangs". They are shown below.

    <h3>What is swell?</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Swell is a series of waves that were generated by distant weather perturbations.</p>
    <h3>What is swell high and period?</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Just like a wave that we learn in the school, swell high is the distance between through and crest, and swell period is the duration of time it takes for a wave to pass a certain point.</p>
    <h3>But why is swell so important?</h3>
	<p>&emsp;The longer the swell period, the faster and more powerful waves will be, since it traveled far enough to gain speed and power</p>
	<h3>Is the swell direction relevant?</h3>
	<p>&emsp;Yes! The swell direction shows how the waves will break as it approaches to the shoreline.</p>
	<h3>What the wind velocity and direction can result?</h3>
	<p>&emsp;When the wind blows too hard, the wind direction does matter much, since it will be a problem to have a "surfable" wave. However, when the wind velocity is low, the direction matters. Winds blowing from land to the sea create very smooth and well groomed waves that can typically take a barrel shape.
	<br>&emsp;Generally, due to the wind, most surf spots have better surfing conditions in the early morning and in the evening.</p>
	<h3>What about the tide?</h3>
	<p>&emsp;Surf spots with sand bars tend to work better with medium to high tide, while reef breaks on low to medium tide. The good thing is that the tides are controlled by the moon, and in a day there are 2 high tides and 2 low tides. Thus, it easier to predict better surfing conditions.
